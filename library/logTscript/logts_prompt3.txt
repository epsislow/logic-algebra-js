please check script_editor_v0_3_1_last_version.html and lib/main.js. 
I want a way to add devices from the script and give values or connect them to existing references, examples:

#when executing the script, on run() the devices() will be cleared.

2wire a = 11

comp [led] 1bit .power:
     text: "PWR"
     color: ^2ecc71
     = 0
     :

# this adds the device component .power that has a 1bit input 
# the text is the label attribute of the led that will be added in the devices  
# the color is the color attribute of the led 
# the = 0 is the value given when the devices is added 
# it should execute the js function: 
#addLed({
#  id: someGeneratedStringId,
#  text: "PWR",
#  color: "#2ecc71",
#  value: true
#});


.power = a.0
#this connects the value of the led to the reference a.0 -> the first bit of a is 1 -> led lights on
#this means that if a.0 value changes the led should show the change 
# executs the js function
# setLed( someGeneratedStringId, true);


a = 00
#when this assignment happens because the first bit of a is now 0 -> led lights off
# executs the js function
# setLed( someGeneratedStringId, false)

a.0 = 1
#when this assignment happens because the first bit of a is now 1 -> led lights on
# executs the js function
# setLed( someGeneratedStringId, true)

comp [led] 1bit .error:
     color: ^f44
     text:"ERR"
     :
#the attributes can be given in any order, the color can be short like in css
#value can be missed this means it will be 0
#will execute:
#addLed({
#  id: someGeneratedStringId2,
#  text: "ERR",
#  color: "#f44",
#  value: false
#});

.error = 1
.power = 0

comp [led] 1bit .test:
   color: ^f0f,
   radius: 0
   :
#text can be missed this means it won't have a label 
#radius is another attribute that gets into the js execution
#will execute:
#addLed({
#  id: someGeneratedStringId3,
#  color: "#f0f",
#  radius: 0,
#  value: false
#});


comp [led] 6bit .l:
    color: ^00ff99
    text: "OUT"
    radius: 0
    nl
    :
#this led has 6bits this means it converts into 6 consecutive leds
#the text is for the first led js execution
#nl attribute translates into the js execution as nl: true in the last led 
#will execute a js like this:
#addLed({ text: 'OUT',  id: "l.1", color: "#00ff99", value: false, radius:0 });
#addLed({ id: "l.2", color: "#00ff99", value: false, radius:0 });
#addLed({ id: "l.3", color: "#00ff99", value: false, radius:0 });
#addLed({ id: "l.4", color: "#00ff99", value: false, radius:0 });
#addLed({ id: "l.5", color: "#00ff99", value: false, radius:0 });
#addLed({ id: "l.6", color: "#00ff99", value: false, radius:0, nl: true });

.l = 000001
#this assignemnt will trigger the led light changes accordingly
#executes: 
#setLed("l.1", false);
#setLed("l.2", false);
#setLed("l.3", false);
#setLed("l.4", false);
#setLed("l.5", false);
#setLed("l.6", true);

comp [led] 6bit .t:
    color:^0f9
    text: "OUT2"
    radius: 0
    = 011011
    nl
    :

# the : is the return of the definition block and it means that the led components cannot be assigned to other values 

1bit ret = .t 
#this gives an error that ret cannot be assigned to a 0 bit component

comp [switch] 1bit .wifi:
    text: "WIFI"
    :1bit
#this is the switch component 
# the text is the label attribute
# it has a 1bit return that is the value that will change when the checkbox changes state (onclick)
# executes: 
#addSwitch({
#    text: "WIFI",
#    value: true,
#    onChange: state => someInternalInterpretorMethod
#});

.power = .wifi
#this is connects the .power led with the value of the .wifi switch
#when the .wifi checkbox is pressed it will execute the js someInternalInterpretorMethod and the value of the .power will change checked means = 1 not checked means 0
#it should execute a setLed()

.l.0 = .wifi 
#this also works
#this means that the first bit of .l comes from the state of the .wifi checkbox
#it should execute a setLed() 




The switches that are checkboxes will trigger changes because the coresponding components change the value of the conected references and those references are connected with other elements functions/statements inside script and those should also be processed.

2bit a = 01

comp [led] 1bit .power:
     text: "PWR"
     color: ^2ecc71
     = 0
     :


comp [switch] 1bit .wifi:
    text: "WIFI"
    :1bit


.power = .wifi
