1. generators
    generates units after an amount of time.
2. producer
    consumes quantities of generated unit types
    after an amount of time, to produce a quantity
    of a new unit type.
3. storage
   stores a finite number of quantities of unit types.
4. recover
   recovers quantities of consumed unit types from
   a quantity of produced unit type after an amount of
   time.
5. transporter
   moves a finite number of quantities of unit types,
   after an amount of time, from a source to a 
   destination location.
6. unlocker
   requests a number of quantities of unit types, 
   to unlock, after an amount of time, new unit types.

How to calculate giving all the required inputs, 
what the number of inputs will become, after a certain
time duration?

Is there a better way except using
addition and subtraction?

storage: 100 a, 100 b
generator: +1 a, every 5s at 0 delay 
transport: -9 a, every 9s at 1s delay
transport: -9 a, every 9s at 3s delay
transport: -9 a, every 9s at 12s delay
producer: -5 a, -5 b, +1 c, every 10s at 0s delay
(the order counts)

how many c after 60s?

100b => max 100/5 = 20c
t0:  100a, 0c
t1:  91a, 0c
t3:  82a, 0c,
t5:  83a, 0c
t10: 78a, 1c
t10: 69a, 1c
